# Engineering-Grade-Pending-C-
C++ based GUI program that calculates the GP (Grade Pending) and CGPA (Cummulative Grade Pending Average) of an engineering student in the University of Benin


The framework used here is wxWidgets. For information on how to setup your workstation/environment for development, compilation and IDE integration, please visit the wxWidgets website and consult the appropriate resource.
All code was written with the Linux operating system, specifically Ubuntu 18.04.04.
Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 was used to compile the code to generate the windows executable. Note that there were adjustments made to the code base to make some data types compatible with a lower version of C++. 
All .dlls required by Windows [when try to execute the programme within the Windows operating system] are 32 bit dlls NOT 64 bit. 


There was also repetition of the map containing course codes and their credit loads. This was done to avoid the use of header files or anything else than one (1) singular source code.
I'm a Python Developer. 
Hence, one-codebase-to-rule-them-all is far more comfortable for me. 


Feel free to ask any questions and open issues.
